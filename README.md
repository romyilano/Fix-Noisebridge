# Noisebridge Fixit iPhone App 


Wiki:
https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_iPhone_Fixit_App

This is initially to fix stuff at Noisebridge.
I'd like to add the Noisebridge Todo lists and eventually include an educational component for each station at Noisebridge. I'd like to see a Laser Cutter tutorial on video in this app if possible.

In the far future it would be nice to add QR codes as well.
